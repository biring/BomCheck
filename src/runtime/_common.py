"""
Shared runtime resource management utilities.

This module centralizes the core mechanisms for loading, validating, and
caching runtime string resources (e.g., UI messages) from JSON files.
It ensures that resources are well-formed, checksum-verified, and meet
their schema requirements before being stored in a module-specific cache.

Main capabilities:
 - `Cache` class for storing a single named resource mapping (string keys → string values)
 - Loading of JSON-backed runtime resources with integrity and key validation
 - Automatic key export helper for building `__all__` from constants
 - File path resolution to runtime resources within the project tree

Example Usage:
    # Preferred usage via a category module (e.g., _info.py):
    from src.runtime import interfaces as rt
    welcome_msg = rt.info_msg.get(rt.info_key.WELCOME)

    # Direct usage (internal/testing only):
    from src.runtime import _common as common
    cache = common.Cache()
    data_map = common.load_runtime_json("_info", ["WELCOME", "APP_NAME"])
    cache.load_resource("_info", data_map)
    print(cache.get_value("_info", "WELCOME"))

Dependencies:
 - Python >= 3.10
 - Standard Library: typing
 - Internal modules: src.utils.directory, src.utils.file, src.utils.json

Notes:
 - This is an internal utility module for `runtime` category loaders.
 - Designed for lazy-loading: JSON resources are loaded only when first accessed.
 - The `Cache` instance is module-scoped per category (not a global singleton).
 - JSON resources must follow the "foundation" structure with meta/checksum/data sections.
