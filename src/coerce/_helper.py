"""
Regex-based coercion engine with traceable change logs.

This module implements the internal engine that applies ordered regex-based `Rule` transformations and records human-readable logs for each change. It powers BOM field coercion within the coerce package.

Example Usage:
    # Preferred usage via package interface:
    # Not exposed publicly; this is an internal module.

    # Direct internal access (for tests or internal scripts only):
    from src.coerce import _helper
    from src.coerce._types import Rule
    text = "A\tB  C"
    rules = [Rule(r"\t+", " ", "Replace tabs with spaces"), Rule(r" {2,}", " ", "Collapse multiple spaces")]
    result = _helper.apply_rule(text, rules, attr_name="description")
    print(result.coerced_value)  # "A B C"

Dependencies:
    - Python >= 3.10
    - Standard Library: re, dataclasses, typing
    - Internal: src.coerce._types.Rule, Result, Log

Notes:
    - This module is an internal implementation detail; all external access should go through `src.coerce.interfaces`.

    Render control characters visibly and truncate long strings.

    Replaces newline and tab with their visible escape sequences and shortens overly long strings with a single ellipsis to produce safe, human-readable log snippets.

    Args:
        text (str): The input string to render.
        max_len (int, optional): Maximum length of the returned preview. Defaults to 32.

    Returns:
        str: A readable preview with control characters escaped and length limited.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If max_len is less than 1.

    Apply ordered regex coercion rules and collect per-rule change logs.

    Each rule runs sequentially; the output of one becomes the input to the next. A change log entry is recorded only when a rule makes a substitution.

        rules (list[Rule]): Ordered list of coercion rules with pattern, replacement, and description.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If rules is not a list of Rule instances.
        ValueError: If attr_name is empty or whitespace.
        re.error: If any rule contains an invalid regex pattern.
