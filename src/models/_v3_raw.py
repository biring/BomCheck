"""
Raw data model for the version 3 BOM template.

This module defines structured Python dataclasses that mirror the layout of version 3 excel based Bill of Materials (BOM) files. It captures metadata, board-level information, and individual rows exactly as they appear in the source, with all fields represented as plain strings.

These models serve as the initial parsed representation created by BOM parsers before any standardization, normalization, or mapping to canonical models.

Main capabilities:
     - Encodes board-level BOM metadata (model number, revision, supplier, cost breakdown)
     - Encodes component-level BOM rows (reference, part number, quantity, price)
     - Supports multiple board BOMs within a single file
     - Provides factory methods (`empty`) for zero-initialized object creation

Example Usage:
    # Preferred usage via public package interface:
    # Not exposed publicly; this is an internal module.

    # Direct module usage (acceptable in unit tests or internal scripts only):
    import src.models._v3_model import model
    board = model.Board.empty()

Dependencies:
     - Python >= 3.10
     - Standard Library: dataclasses

Notes:
     - All fields are strings to simplify parsing and tolerate missing values.
     - This model reflects raw BOM data; downstream processing should not modify it.
     - Used primarily by `v3_bom_parser` to convert Excel sheets to structured form.
