"""
Utility functions for safe and minimal file path operations.

This module provides reusable, stateless helpers for working with file paths. It is designed for use across application layers, especially where low-level file operations are needed without business logic coupling.

Main Capabilities:
    - Join and normalize file paths
    - Check if a path exists and is a file
    - Escape backslashes for safe display/logging
    - Validate file for Windows compatibility
    - List files in a directory with optional extension filtering

Example Usage:
    # Preferred usage via package interface:
    # Not exposed publicly; this is an internal module.

    # Direct module usage (acceptable for tests or internal scripts):
    import src.utils._file_path as fp
    if fp.is_existing_file("config/settings.yaml"):
        print("Valid config file found.")

Dependencies:
    - Python >= 3.10
    - Standard Library: os, typing

Notes:
    - This module assumes caller responsibility for input validation and higher-level error handling.
    - All functions are stateless and do not maintain any internal context.
    - Designed for cross-layer utility use, including in CLI tools, UI layers, and service/controllers.
