"""
Utilities for reading/writing Excel workbooks with predictable string typing and safe sheet naming.

This module provides helpers to:
     - Read all worksheets from an `.xlsx` into DataFrames with every cell as `str` and blanks as ""
     - Write a single DataFrame to an Excel file (no index), using the `openpyxl` engine
     - Write multiple DataFrames to one workbook, skipping empty frames and sanitizing sheet names
     - Sanitize worksheet names to satisfy Excel constraints (invalid chars removed, length <= 31)

Example Usage:
    # Preferred usage via package interface:
    # Not exposed publicly; this is an internal module.

    # Direct module usage (acceptable in unit tests or internal scripts only):
    import src.utils._excel_io as excel_io
    df = excel_io.read_from_excel_file("book.xlsx")

Dependencies:
    - Python >= 3.9
    - External: pandas (tested with pandas >= 2.x), openpyxl
    - Standard Library: re

Notes:
     - All reads coerce cells to `str` and preserve blanks as empty strings (`na_filter=False`).
     - Workbooks are opened via context managers to ensure file handles close cleanly on Windows.
     - `write_sheets_to_excel` skips empty DataFrames; if all are empty, it raises `ValueError`.
     - Sheet names are sanitized to remove [: \\ / ? * [ ]] and truncated to 31 chars; pass a falsy name to let pandas assign a default.
     - Public functions are intended for internal use within the `utils` package to keep serialization behavior consistent across layers.
