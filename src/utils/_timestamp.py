"""
Utility functions for working with date and time.

Example Usage:
    # Preferred usage via public package interface:
    from src.utils import timestamp
    ts = timestamp.now_utc_iso()

    # Direct module usage (acceptable in unit tests or internal scripts only):
    import src.utils._timestamp as timestamp
    ts = timestamp.now_utc_iso()

Dependencies:
    - Python >= 3.9
    - Standard Library: datetime

Notes:
    - Intended as an internal implementation module backing src.utils.timestamp.
    - Output formats are stable and optimized for filenames, logs, and lightweight identifiers.
    - All functions are pure helpers; they read the system clock but perform no I/O or stateful operations.
