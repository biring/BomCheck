"""
Version-3 Bill-of-Materials (BOM) verification orchestrator.

This module coordinates all field-level and logic-level verification for a V3 BOM. It delegates verification to the public `approve` interfaces and raises context-rich errors that include the failing function name and the underlying rule violation. It is used by the BOM ingestion pipeline to guarantee row and header integrity before normalization or persistence.

Example Usage:
    # Preferred usage via package interface:
    # Not exposed publicly; this is an internal module.

    # Direct module usage (acceptable in unit tests or internal scripts only):
    from src.verifiers import _v3_bom as verify
    verify.verify_v3_bom(bom)

Dependencies:
    - Python >= 3.10
    - Standard Library: None
    - Internal Modules:
        * src.approve.interfaces  (field + logic verification)
        * src.models.interfaces   (BOM, Board, Row, Header models)

Notes:
    - Fail-fast: the first ValueError halts verification with contextual details.
    - Unexpected exceptions are wrapped in RuntimeError with function context.

License:
    Internal Use Only.
