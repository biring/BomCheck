"""
JSON resource cache for shared runtime settings and configuration.

This module centralizes loading of JSON-backed resources (settings, configuration files, message catalogs) from project runtime folders, verifies checksums and required keys, and exposes type-safe cached access to their values.

Example Usage:
    # Preferred usage via package interface:
    from src.common import JsonCache
    cache = JsonCache(
        resource_folder="C://runtime/config",
        resource_name="settings",
        required_keys=("app_version", "log_level"),
    )
    log_level = cache.get_value("log_level", str)

    # Direct internal usage (tests or internal tooling only):
    from src.common._json_cache import JsonCache
    cache = JsonCache(
        resource_folder="D://runtime/messages",
        resource_name="log_msg",
        required_keys=("E001",),
    )
    message = cache.get_value("E001", str)

Dependencies:
    - Python >= 3.10
    - Standard Library: copy, typing
    - Internal Packages: src.utils (JSON file I/O, path and checksum helpers)

Notes:
    - Internal-only module; JsonCache is re-exported from src.common for shared settings, configuration, and message catalogs.
    - Intended for read-only JSON resources that are loaded once at startup and reused across the application.
    - get_value enforces the expected type for each key and exposes keys and data via defensive copies.
