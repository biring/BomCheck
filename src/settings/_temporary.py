"""
JSON-backed temporary settings stored in the application temp folder.

This module provides:
    - Strongly typed keys for temporary settings used across workflows
    - A JSON cache–based loader (CacheReadWrite) for reading and persisting the temporary settings file
    - A lazy singleton accessor for internal components that require shared temp state

These settings are intended for short-lived, workflow-level state such as last-used source and destination folders, without touching user-facing configuration files.

Example Usage:
    # Preferred usage via public package interface:
    # Not applicable. This module is internal.

    # Direct module usage (allowed in tests or internal scripts):
    from src.settings import _temporary as tmp
    cache = tmp.get_temp_settings()
    cache.update_value(tmp.KEYS.DESTINATION_FILES_FOLDER, "/path/out")

Dependencies:
    - Python >= 3.10
    - Standard Library: typing
    - External Packages: None
    - Internal Modules: src.common.CacheReadWrite, src.utils.folder_path

Notes:
    - This module is internal to the settings subsystem; it is not part of the public API.
    - Required keys are defined at import time and enforced when creating or loading the JSON file.
    - If the backing JSON is missing or invalid, CacheReadWrite creates a new file populated with the default values defined in _DEFAULT_TEMP_SETTINGS.
    - A singleton cache is exposed via get_temp_settings() to minimize disk I/O.
