"""
Internal utilities for building standardized filenames from BOM metadata.

This module provides internal helpers for composing deterministic, filesystem-safe filenames derived from BOM header fields. It is intended to centralize filename construction logic used across logging, auditing, and pipeline outputs.

Filename composition may include:
    - Local date
    - Model number
    - Build stage
    - Optional board name (single-board BOMs only)
    - Fixed context-specific suffixes

All whitespace is removed to ensure portability across filesystems.

Example Usage:
    # Preferred usage via public interfaces:
    # Not applicable; this is an internal module.

    # Direct module usage (acceptable in unit tests or internal scripts only):
    from src.exporters import _build_filename as builder
    name = builder.build_checker_log_filename(bom)

Dependencies:
    - Python >= 3.10
    - Standard Library: None
    - Internal Packages: src.models.interfaces, src.utils.timestamp

Notes:
    - Assumes BOMs contain at least one board.
    - Header-derived fields are taken from the first board by convention.
    - Board names are omitted for multi-board BOMs.
    - New builders must remain deterministic and whitespace-free.
