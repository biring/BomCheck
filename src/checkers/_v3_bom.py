"""
Checker for Version 3 BOM objects.

Coordinates value-level and logic-level checks across complete BOMs (boards, headers, rows) and returns accumulated diagnostics in a printable, uniform format without performing any direct I/O.

Example Usage:
    # Preferred usage via public package interface:
    # Not exposed publicly; this is an internal module.

    # Direct module usage (acceptable in unit tests or internal scripts only):
    from src.checkers import _bom as cb
    issues = cb.check_bom(...)
    print(issues)

Dependencies:
    - Python >= 3.10
    - Internal:
        - src.common.ChangeLog (IssueLog)
        - src.review.interfaces (field and logic checks)
        - src.models.interfaces (Bom, Board, Header, Row)

Notes:
    - Returns a tuple of diagnostic strings; does not raise on validation errors or perform logging/printing.
    - Separates header/row value checks from cross-field logic checks while sharing a common IssueLog accumulator.
    - Intended for internal use only; public callers should go through src.checkers.interfaces to preserve API boundaries.
